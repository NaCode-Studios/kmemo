/**
 * Finds the similarity threshold that fits *your* embedding model, by measuring instead of guessing.
 *
 * A threshold copied from a blog post is a threshold tuned to somebody else's model. The same pair
 * of prompts might score 0.86 with one embedding model and 0.94 with another, so a value that is
 * safely tight for one is dangerously loose for the next — and the failure is silent, because a
 * false hit looks exactly like a fast response.
 *
 * Give the calibrator prompt pairs you have labelled and it sweeps the threshold range, reporting
 * how many correct hits and how many wrong answers each setting produces on your own model, with
 * your own guards in the loop:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val report = ThresholdCalibrator(myEmbedder).calibrate(myLabelledPairs)
 * println(report.summary())
 * val cache = SemanticCache(myEmbedder, threshold = report.recommended.threshold)
 * ```
 *
 * A hundred pairs drawn from your own traffic is plenty, and half of them should be near-misses:
 * prompts that look alike but need different answers. Pairs that are obviously unrelated teach the
 * calibrator nothing, because no threshold ever confuses them.
 *
 * @param embedder the model you intend to cache with — results do not transfer between models.
 * @param guards the guards you intend to run. Pass [MatchGuards.none] to measure the
 *   similarity-only baseline and see what the guards are buying you.
