/**
 * Default [CacheStore]: entries in a map, search by scanning them.
 *
 * Good enough to start with and honest about its ceiling. Search is a linear scan of every entry in
 * the scope, so cost grows with cache size — at the default 10,000 entries and 1,536-dimensional
 * vectors a lookup is well under a millisecond, which is nothing next to the network call it
 * replaces. Past roughly 100,000 entries, or as soon as you want the cache shared between instances
 * or to survive a restart, move to a real vector store.
 *
 * Eviction is least-recently-*used*, not least-recently-written, and "used" means served: only a
 * confirmed hit calls [touch]. An entry that keeps scoring second place never gets credit for it.
 *
 * Every method takes a mutex, so the store is safe to share across coroutines and threads.
 *
 * @param maxEntries hard cap across all scopes; the least recently used entry goes first.
 * @param ttl how long an entry stays valid, or `null` to keep entries until they are evicted.
 *   Expired entries are never returned by [search] and are dropped as they are encountered.
 * @param clock time source; substitute a fixed clock in tests instead of sleeping.
