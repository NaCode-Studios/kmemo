/**
 * A cache keyed by what a prompt *means* rather than by its exact bytes.
 *
 * Every prompt is embedded, compared against the prompts already cached, and — if something is close
 * enough and survives the guards — answered from the cache instead of from the model. Two prompts
 * worded differently but asking the same thing hit the same entry, which an exact-match cache can
 * never do.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val cache = SemanticCache(
 *     embedder = myEmbedder,
 *     store = InMemoryStore(maxEntries = 10_000, ttl = 1.hours),
 * )
 *
 * val answer = cache.getOrPut(prompt) { llm.complete(it) }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Why this is not just a threshold
 *
 * The failure mode of a semantic cache is not a miss, it is a **false hit**: returning a cached
 * answer to a question it does not answer. `Convert 100 USD to EUR` and `Convert 250 USD to EUR`
 * embed at around 0.99 with every mainstream model. There is no threshold that accepts real
 * paraphrases and rejects that pair, because on the similarity axis the pair is *closer* than most
 * paraphrases are.
 *
 * So similarity is only the first filter here. Candidates that clear [threshold] are then read as
 * text by a chain of [MatchGuard]s looking for concrete evidence that the answers must differ — a
 * different number, unit, entity, time reference, or a flipped comparison. Anything that survives
 * can be sent to an optional [Verifier] for a final check. The costs are asymmetric and the defaults
 * follow that: a wrong rejection costs one API call, a wrong acceptance costs a wrong answer.
 *
 * ### Scopes
 *
 * Every entry belongs to a `scope`, and lookups only see their own. Anything that changes what a
 * correct answer looks like — model, temperature, system prompt, tenant, user's language — belongs
 * in the scope string, otherwise the cache will happily serve one model's answer to another's
 * caller:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * cache.getOrPut(prompt, scope = "gpt-4o|t=0.0|v3") { llm.complete(it) }
 * ```
 *
 * Instances are safe to share across coroutines, as long as the [Embedder] and [CacheStore] are.
 *
 * @param embedder turns prompts into vectors; you supply it.
 * @param store where entries live and how they expire. Defaults to a bounded in-memory store.
 * @param threshold minimum cosine similarity for a candidate to be considered at all. The default
 *   is deliberately tight; calibrate it against your own model with
 *   [dev.kmemo.calibration.ThresholdCalibrator] rather than guessing.
 * @param guards vetoes applied to candidates that clear [threshold]. [MatchGuards.standard] by
 *   default; [MatchGuards.none] reproduces the naive similarity-only behaviour.
 * @param verifier optional final check, typically a cheap model call, run only on candidates that
 *   already passed everything else.
 * @param verifierTimeout optional cap on a single [Verifier.verify] call. On timeout — or if the
 *   verifier throws — the candidate is **rejected**, not served: a check that could not complete must
 *   fail closed, since the verifier exists precisely to keep an unconfirmed answer out. `null` (the
 *   default) applies no timeout.
 * @param candidates how many nearest entries to consider. Looking past the closest one matters:
 *   when a guard rejects the top candidate, the second may still be a correct answer.
 * @param coalesceConcurrentMisses whether concurrent [getOrPut] calls for the same prompt in the
 *   same scope wait for the first one instead of each calling the model. On by default: a cold
 *   cache under load is the case where duplicate calls are most expensive and most likely.
 * @param embedFailurePolicy what [getOrPut] does when the [Embedder] throws — propagate (the default)
 *   or fall back to [compute] so a lookup is never *worse* than no cache. See [EmbedFailurePolicy].
 *   [lookup], [get] and [put] have no fallback and always propagate. [CancellationException] always
 *   propagates.
 * @param negativeCacheSize when positive, turns on a bounded negative cache: the embedding of a prompt
 *   that just missed is remembered, so an immediate repeat of the *same brand-new prompt* is embedded
 *   once rather than once per caller. Extends the concurrent-miss coalescing to the near-in-time
 *   sequential case. It only ever reuses an embedding — it never suppresses the store search — so it
 *   cannot cause a false hit. `0` (the default) keeps it off.
 * @param negativeCacheTtl how long a remembered miss stays usable when [negativeCacheSize] is positive,
 *   or `null` to keep it until evicted. A short TTL is the point: it should cover a burst, not pin a
 *   stale embedding for a prompt that has since been answered elsewhere.
 * @param listeners observers notified of every hit, miss and write as it happens (see [CacheEvent]).
 *   Empty by default, and an empty list is free: with no listeners the cache builds no events and
 *   measures no latencies, so the hot path is exactly as it was. Each listener runs inline and must be
 *   fast and non-throwing — see [CacheListener].
 * @param writeBehindScope when non-null, turns on **write-behind**: on a [getOrPut] miss the cache
 *   returns as soon as [compute] does and the store write is applied off the caller's critical path,
 *   by a single worker running on this scope. Writes are applied in submission order while buffered;
 *   if the buffer is full the write falls through synchronously rather than being dropped, so a write
 *   is never lost (only, rarely, reordered under saturation). The window between compute and write is
 *   a small chance of a duplicate compute for the same brand-new prompt. Cancel this scope to stop the
 *   worker. `null` (the default) writes through synchronously, and [put]/[warm] always do.
 * @param writeBehindCapacity how many pending writes to buffer before falling through to a synchronous
 *   write. Only meaningful when [writeBehindScope] is set.
 * @param clock time source for entry timestamps.
