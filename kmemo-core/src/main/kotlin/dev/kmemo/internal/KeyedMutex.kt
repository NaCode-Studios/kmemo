/**
 * Serializes work per key, holding a lock only while someone is actually using it.
 *
 * A plain `Map<String, Mutex>` leaks: every distinct prompt ever seen leaves a mutex behind, and a
 * cache's whole job is to see a great many distinct prompts. Striping into a fixed array fixes the
 * leak and creates a worse problem — unrelated prompts collide and serialize behind each other,
 * which for work measured in seconds of model latency is a throughput cliff.
 *
 * Not reentrant, because the underlying [Mutex] is not: taking the same key twice from one
 * coroutine deadlocks permanently, with no timeout to rescue it. In practice that means the
 * `compute` block of a coalesced call must not call back into the cache for the same prompt.
 *
 * So entries are reference-counted and removed when the last waiter leaves. The bookkeeping runs
 * under [NonCancellable] because it lives in a `finally`, and a suspending cleanup in a cancelled
 * coroutine would otherwise be skipped — leaking the very entry it exists to remove.
