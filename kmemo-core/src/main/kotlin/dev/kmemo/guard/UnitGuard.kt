package dev.kmemo.guard

/**
 * Rejects matches whose prompts mention different units or currencies.
 *
 * `Convert 50 km to miles` and `Convert 50 km to meters` share their number, share four of five
 * words, and embed almost identically — [NumericGuard] sees nothing wrong and word overlap is high
 * enough to pass any sane lexical check. The only thing that differs is the unit, so that is what
 * this guard reads.
 *
 * Comparison is by set, not by sequence: "convert 50 km to miles" and "how many miles is 50 km"
 * mention the same two units and mean the same thing. Direction swaps like `EUR to USD` against
 * `USD to EUR` are [DirectionGuard]'s job.
 *
 * Like [EntityGuard], it rejects a **substitution** and not an addition. Each prompt must name a
 * unit the other does not, so "375 f to c" still matches "What is 375 degrees Fahrenheit in
 * Celsius?" — one of them simply spells the units out.
 *
 * Units are compared by their canonical name, so `km` and `kilometers` are one unit rather than a
 * swap. See [Vocabulary.UNITS].
