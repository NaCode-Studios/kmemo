/**
 * Rejects matches that pin the question to different moments in time.
 *
 * "What is the weather in Chicago today?" and "What is the weather in Chicago tomorrow?" are the
 * same question about a different day, and a cache that cannot tell them apart will confidently
 * serve yesterday's forecast forever.
 *
 * Only absolute references count — see [Vocabulary.TEMPORAL_MARKERS] for why `next` and `last` are
 * excluded. Year numbers are already handled by [NumericGuard], so this guard covers the words that
 * carry a date without carrying a digit.
