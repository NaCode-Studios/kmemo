     *
     * Only the very first token is exempt, not the first token of every sentence. Skipping capitals
     * after `.` `:` `;` sounds more correct and is much worse in practice, because the punctuation
     * that precedes an entity is usually not a sentence boundary at all: "Compare Python vs. Java"
     * would lose `Java`, and a templated "Country: Austria. Give me the capital." would lose
     * `Austria` — the exact field that varies between two prompts, and the only reason to run this
     * guard. A stray sentence-opening word costs nothing here, since [EntityGuard] only rejects on
     * entities unique to *both* sides and a word both prompts share cancels out.
     *
     * Returned lowercased, so `GitHub` and `Github` are the same entity.
