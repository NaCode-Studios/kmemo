     * Tokens that look like named entities: capitalized, minus the words that are capitalized purely
     * by grammar. `France`, `GitHub` and `OAuth` qualify in "what is the capital of France"; the
     * leading `What` does not.
     *
     * Deciding which capitals are grammar is the whole difficulty, and both obvious answers are
     * wrong.
     *
     * Treating `.` `:` `;` as sentence boundaries disables the guard on exactly the prompts it
     * exists for: "Compare Python vs. Java" loses `Java` to the abbreviation period, and a templated
     * "Country: Austria. Give me the capital." loses `Austria` to the colon — the one field that
     * varies between two prompts.
     *
     * Exempting only the very first token of the prompt goes wrong in the other direction: the
     * opening word of every *later* sentence becomes an entity, so "…in CSS? Show me an example."
     * and "…in CSS? Give me an example." look like an entity swap and a genuine paraphrase is
     * refused.
     *
     * So: only `.` `?` `!` end a sentence, never `:` or `;`; a period does not end one when the word
     * before it is an abbreviation or a single letter, which covers `vs.`, `e.g.` and initials; and
     * a word that opens a sentence is excused **only if it is a word we know to be ordinary**.
     *
     * That last rule is the one that matters. Excusing every sentence-opening capital loses the
     * entity in "I am planning a holiday. Austria is where I want to go." — a false hit, the
     * expensive direction. Excusing none of them refuses "…? Show me an example." against "…? Give
     * me an example." — a false rejection, which costs one API call. So the default is to treat a
     * sentence-opening capital as an entity, and [Vocabulary.SENTENCE_OPENERS] carves out the
     * grammar words. An unusual opener costs a call; a missed entity costs a wrong answer.
     *
     * Returned lowercased, so `GitHub` and `Github` are the same entity.
