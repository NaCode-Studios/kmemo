package dev.kmemo.guard

/**
 * Rejects matches whose prompts do not contain the same numbers.
 *
 * The highest-value guard in the set, because numbers are where embeddings are weakest. `Convert 100
 * USD to EUR` and `Convert 250 USD to EUR` are ~99% cosine-similar with every mainstream embedding
 * model: the sentences are near-identical and the model was never trained to treat magnitude as
 * meaning. No threshold separates them. Reading the digits does, exactly and for free.
 *
 * Numbers are compared as a sorted multiset, so re-ordering a prompt does not trigger a rejection,
 * and thousands separators are stripped so `1,000` and `1000` are the same number. A number present
 * on one side only also counts as a difference — that is what catches `Explain OAuth 2.0` against
 * `Explain OAuth 2.0 to a 5 year old`.
 *
 * A comma only counts as a thousands separator when exactly three digits follow it. Stripping every
 * comma is the obvious implementation and it quietly breaks the guard outside the US: `3,5` would
 * become `35`, and "Convert 3,5 km to miles" would be served the answer cached for 35 km — the
 * precise failure this guard exists to prevent, reintroduced by the normalization meant to help.
