/**
 * Rejects matches where one prompt is negated and the other is not.
 *
 * Negation is close to invisible to an embedding model: "is this column nullable" and "is this
 * column not nullable" are one short function word apart, and that word carries the entire answer.
 *
 * The test is presence, not count, so two differently-phrased negatives ("no such file" and "file
 * not found") still match each other. Contractions are caught by an `n't` substring test, which
 * survives any tokenizer that splits on apostrophes.
