/**
 * Rejects matches that talk about different named things.
 *
 * "What is the capital of Australia" and "what is the capital of Austria" differ by two letters and
 * one continent. Embedding models place them extremely close — both are capital-city questions
 * about a European-sounding place — which makes this the classic false hit. Capitalization is the
 * cheapest available signal that a token names something specific, so the guard compares the
 * capitalized words of the two prompts.
 *
 * Three rules keep it from misfiring:
 *
 * **The opening capital is ignored.** `What` in "What is Docker" is grammar, not an entity. Only
 * the first word is exempt — see [Text.entityTokens] for why treating every `.` `:` `;` as a
 * sentence boundary silently disables this guard on exactly the prompts it exists for.
 *
 * **It rejects on substitution, not on addition.** Each prompt must name something the other does
 * not: `Austria` here, `Australia` there. One prompt merely mentioning an extra entity is not
 * evidence of a different question — "What does SOLID stand for in OOP?" and "what does each letter
 * of SOLID mean in object oriented design?" want the same answer, and only one of them abbreviates.
 *
 * **Pronouns and initials do not count.** English capitalizes `I`, which would otherwise make every
 * first-person question look like it named something.
