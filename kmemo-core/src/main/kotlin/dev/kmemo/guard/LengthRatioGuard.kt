/**
 * Rejects matches where one prompt is far longer than the other.
 *
 * A one-line question and a three-paragraph one rarely want the same answer even when they cover
 * the same topic, and length is a decent proxy for how much detail was asked for. It is only a
 * proxy, though — "python list reverse" and "How do I reverse a list in Python?" are a four-fold
 * difference in tokens and the same question — so this guard is not part of
 * [MatchGuards.standard]. Reach for it through [MatchGuards.strict], or add it directly, when
 * your traffic mixes short queries with long ones and you would rather pay for the call.
