/**
 * Rejects matches where the same words appear in an order that reverses the question.
 *
 * "Is Postgres better than MySQL?" and "Is MySQL better than Postgres?" contain an identical bag of
 * words. Every set-based check — word overlap, entity comparison, embedding similarity — sees two
 * copies of the same question, because in the bag-of-words view that is exactly what they are.
 *
 * Word order alone cannot be the signal, though: "In Python, how do I sort a dictionary by value?"
 * and "How do I sort a dictionary by value in Python?" are also a reordering, and they must stay a
 * hit. Two conditions narrow the guard to real swaps.
 *
 * **A cue must be present** — a comparison or a conversion, the constructions where argument order
 * carries meaning. And **the words must be the same**; different words are somebody else's problem,
 * which keeps "how many miles is 50 km" matching "convert 50 km to miles".
 *
 * **The reordering must not be a rotation.** Moving a phrase from the end of a sentence to the
 * front rotates the token list, and it never changes the question: "How do I migrate a file in
 * Linux?" and "In Linux, how do I migrate a file?" are one prompt. Swapping two arguments around a
 * cue is a different permutation entirely — no rotation turns `[postgres, better, mysql]` into
 * `[mysql, better, postgres]`. Without this test the guard rejects every fronted prepositional
 * phrase whose sentence happens to contain a cue word, which is a paid API call for nothing.
