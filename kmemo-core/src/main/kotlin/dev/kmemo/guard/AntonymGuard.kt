package dev.kmemo.guard

/**
 * Rejects matches where one prompt asks for the opposite of the other.
 *
 * "How do I enable two factor authentication on GitHub?" and "How do I disable two factor
 * authentication on GitHub?" differ in a single token out of nine. Every other signal a cache can
 * read — length, structure, topic, word overlap — says these are the same question. They are the
 * same question with the answer inverted.
 *
 * The guard looks for a **flip**, not merely a difference: one prompt must use a word *more* than
 * the other while the other uses its opposite *more*. Two things follow from counting rather than
 * testing membership.
 *
 * It stops false rejections. "Run this before deploy" and "run this prior to deploy" differ by the
 * word `before`, but nothing anywhere says `after`, so there is no flip and no rejection.
 *
 * And it still catches flips hidden by an incidental repeat. "How do I turn on format on save in VS
 * Code?" and "How do I turn off format on save in VS Code?" both contain `on` — the second one in
 * "format on save" — so asking whether `on` appears in both says they agree. Counting says the query
 * uses `on` twice to the candidate's once while the candidate uses `off` and the query never does,
 * which is exactly the swap that matters.
