 * similarity collapses into a plain dot product, which removes two square roots from every
 * comparison in the search loop. [CacheEntry] normalizes on construction, so store implementations
 * can safely use [dot] instead of [cosineSimilarity].

     * every real match in its scope for as long as it lives.
