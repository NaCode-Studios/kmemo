/**
 * Turns text into a vector. kmemo ships no embedding implementation on purpose: you bring your own
 * (OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage, a local ONNX model, whatever your stack already pays for), and kmemo
 * stays free of provider SDKs.
 *
 * Implementations must be **deterministic and stable**: the same text must map to the same vector
 * for the lifetime of a cache, and every vector must have the same dimension. Switching embedding
 * model invalidates every entry that came before it — use a fresh store, or a different
 * `scope`, when you do.
 *
 * Implementations are called from coroutines and must be safe to call concurrently.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val embedder = Embedder { text -> openAi.embeddings(model = "text-embedding-3-small", input = text).vector() }
 * ```
