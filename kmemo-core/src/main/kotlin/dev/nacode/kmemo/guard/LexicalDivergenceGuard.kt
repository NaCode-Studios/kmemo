/**
 * Rejects matches whose prompts share too few meaningful words. The backstop under the specialised
 * guards: it catches the swaps nobody wrote a rule for.
 *
 * Function words and politeness filler are stripped first, so "How do I kill a process on a port?"
 * and "Hi, could you please tell me how to kill a process on a port? Thanks!" reduce to nearly the
 * same set. What remains is compared with Jaccard overlap.
 *
 * Two details do most of the work:
 *
 * **Typos are matched fuzzily.** `instal` counts as `install`, so "how do i instal numpy wiht pip"
 * still matches. Matching is capped at one edit between tokens of five characters or more, which is
 * deliberately too strict to merge `Austria` with `Australia`.
 *
 * **[minOverlap] defaults low.** Genuine paraphrases can share surprisingly few words — "How do I
 * undo my last git commit?" and "I committed by mistake in git, how do I take that commit back?"
 * overlap by about a quarter — so a threshold tuned to catch entity swaps on its own would reject
 * real hits. The specialised guards handle the precise cases; this one only fires when two prompts
 * have almost nothing in common and the embedding still claimed a match.
