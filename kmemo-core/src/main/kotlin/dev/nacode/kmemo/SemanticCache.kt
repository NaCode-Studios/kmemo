/**
 * A cache keyed by what a prompt *means* rather than by its exact bytes.
 *
 * Every prompt is embedded, compared against the prompts already cached, and — if something is close
 * enough and survives the guards — answered from the cache instead of from the model. Two prompts
 * worded differently but asking the same thing hit the same entry, which an exact-match cache can
 * never do.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val cache = SemanticCache(
 *     embedder = myEmbedder,
 *     store = InMemoryStore(maxEntries = 10_000, ttl = 1.hours),
 * )
 *
 * val answer = cache.getOrPut(prompt) { llm.complete(it) }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Why this is not just a threshold
 *
 * The failure mode of a semantic cache is not a miss, it is a **false hit**: returning a cached
 * answer to a question it does not answer. `Convert 100 USD to EUR` and `Convert 250 USD to EUR`
 * embed at around 0.99 with every mainstream model. There is no threshold that accepts real
 * paraphrases and rejects that pair, because on the similarity axis the pair is *closer* than most
 * paraphrases are.
 *
 * So similarity is only the first filter here. Candidates that clear [threshold] are then read as
 * text by a chain of [MatchGuard]s looking for concrete evidence that the answers must differ — a
 * different number, unit, entity, time reference, or a flipped comparison. Anything that survives
 * can be sent to an optional [Verifier] for a final check. The costs are asymmetric and the defaults
 * follow that: a wrong rejection costs one API call, a wrong acceptance costs a wrong answer.
 *
 * ### Scopes
 *
 * Every entry belongs to a `scope`, and lookups only see their own. Anything that changes what a
 * correct answer looks like — model, temperature, system prompt, tenant, user's language — belongs
 * in the scope string, otherwise the cache will happily serve one model's answer to another's
 * caller:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * cache.getOrPut(prompt, scope = "gpt-4o|t=0.0|v3") { llm.complete(it) }
 * ```
 *
 * Instances are safe to share across coroutines, as long as the [Embedder] and [CacheStore] are.
 *
 * @param embedder turns prompts into vectors; you supply it.
 * @param store where entries live and how they expire. Defaults to a bounded in-memory store.
 * @param threshold minimum cosine similarity for a candidate to be considered at all. The default
 *   is deliberately tight; calibrate it against your own model with
 *   [dev.nacode.kmemo.calibration.ThresholdCalibrator] rather than guessing.
 * @param guards vetoes applied to candidates that clear [threshold]. [MatchGuards.standard] by
 *   default; [MatchGuards.none] reproduces the naive similarity-only behaviour.
 * @param verifier optional final check, typically a cheap model call, run only on candidates that
 *   already passed everything else.
 * @param candidates how many nearest entries to consider. Looking past the closest one matters:
 *   when a guard rejects the top candidate, the second may still be a correct answer.
 * @param clock time source for entry timestamps.
