## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Fail-closed verifier semantics and `SemanticCache(verifierTimeout = …)` — a `Verifier` that throws
  or exceeds the timeout now rejects the candidate (a `REJECTED_BY_VERIFIER` miss whose `detail` says
  which), instead of propagating the error or serving an unconfirmed answer. `CancellationException`
  still propagates, so cancellation is unaffected.
- `CachingVerifier`, and the `Verifier.caching(…)` extension — memoizes verdicts per
  `(query, cachedPrompt)`, bounded and optionally TTL'd, so a hot near miss is judged once rather than
  on every lookup. A delegate that throws is never cached, so a transient outage cannot freeze a
  rejection into the cache.
- `SemanticCache.explain(prompt, scope)` — a read-only diagnostic returning a `CacheExplanation`: the
  nearest candidates with *every* guard's verdict (not just the first rejection), and a `decision`
  that says whether the threshold or a guard would stand in the way. It moves no counter, marks
  nothing recently-used, and never runs the `Verifier` — the tool for "why wasn't this a hit?".
- `CacheStats.guardRejectionsByGuard` — guard rejections broken down by `MatchGuard.name`, so a noisy
  or silent guard is visible in production and not only in the corpus test. The values sum to
  `guardRejections`, and every configured guard is a key, so one that never fires reads as `0` rather
  than being absent.

### Changed

- The API reference is now published to GitHub Pages with Dokka (`docs.yml`) and linked from the
  README; the repository was renamed to `NaCode-Studios/Kmemo`, and the POM/SCM metadata, GitHub
  Packages URL and CI badges were updated to the canonical location.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

First release. Core semantic cache, provider-agnostic, one transitive dependency.

### Added

- `SemanticCache` — embed, search, threshold, guard, optionally verify. `getOrPut` embeds a prompt
  once and reuses the vector for both the lookup and the write. Concurrent `getOrPut` calls for the
  same prompt and scope are coalesced: the first computes, the rest wait and are served its answer,
  since a cold cache under load is exactly when duplicate calls are most likely and most expensive.
- `Embedder` — bring your own embedding source; Kmemo ships none and depends on no provider SDK.
- `CacheStore` — storage and nearest-neighbour SPI, with `InMemoryStore` as the default: bounded,
  LRU-evicted on confirmed hits, optional TTL, safe across coroutines.
- Ten guards against false cache hits, all on by default: `NumericGuard`, `UnitGuard` (units carry
  the dimension they measure via `MeasurementUnit`, so a mass appearing where a currency does is not
  read as a swapped unit), `TemporalGuard`, `NegationGuard`, `AntonymGuard`, `EntityGuard` (which
  also recognises an acronym written out in full, so `GDPR` matches `General Data Protection
  Regulation`), `SubstitutionGuard` (rejects prompts identical but for one word, reading structure
  rather than capitalization), `ScopeGuard`, `DirectionGuard` (distinguishes an asymmetric comparison
  from a symmetric selection), and `LexicalDivergenceGuard`. `LengthRatioGuard` ships too but stays
  out of `standard()`. The marker guards require the rest of the prompt to match before a keyword
  counts as evidence, and the substitution guards reject a substitution, never an addition.
- The `MatchGuards.standard()` / `strict()` / `none()` presets.
- `Verifier` — optional final check on candidates that already cleared threshold and guards.
- `ThresholdCalibrator` — sweeps thresholds over labelled prompt pairs and reports what each setting
  costs in wrong answers and missed hits, so the threshold is measured against your embedding model
  rather than copied from someone else's.
- Scopes — entries are partitioned, so one model's answers are never served to another's callers.
- `CacheStats` — hit rate plus a breakdown of misses by cause.
- Three labelled corpora, checked on every build: `near-miss-corpus.json` (109 pairs, tuned on),
  `held-out-corpus.json` (128) and a blind `validation-corpus.json` (153, nine tenths lowercase,
  never tuned against). Blind validation rejects 67% of near misses while keeping 88% of paraphrases.
- Published to Maven Central and GitHub Packages under `io.github.nacode-studios` (package
  `dev.kmemo`), with the public API tracked by binary-compatibility-validator (`./gradlew apiCheck`).
