# Kmemo

**A semantic cache for LLM calls on Kotlin/JVM — that refuses to serve you the wrong answer.**

An exact-match cache misses "how do I reverse a list in Python" when it has already answered "python
list reverse". A semantic cache does not: it embeds the prompt, finds the closest one it has seen, and
replays that answer instead of calling the model. Fewer API calls, lower latency, same answers — except
for the part where it hands back the wrong one.

```
"Convert 100 USD to EUR"
"Convert 250 USD to EUR"      cosine similarity: ~0.99
```

Every mainstream embedding model scores that pair around 0.99. No threshold separates it from a genuine
paraphrase, because on the similarity axis **the near miss is closer than most paraphrases are**. So a
cache built on a threshold alone will tell someone that 250 dollars is 92 euros — quickly, with no error
and nothing in the logs. Kmemo treats that as the main event: similarity is only the first filter, and
candidates that clear it are read as text by a chain of guards looking for concrete evidence the answers
must differ.

```kotlin
val cache = SemanticCache(
    embedder = Embedder { text -> openAi.embed(text) },
    store = InMemoryStore(maxEntries = 10_000, ttl = 1.hours),
)

val answer = cache.getOrPut(prompt) { llm.complete(it) }
```

Kmemo caches responses for embeddings you already have — `openAi.embed` above is your own embedding
source; Kmemo ships none and depends on no provider SDK.

> **See it end to end:** [`examples/`](examples) is a runnable demo (no API key needed) that shows a
> guard catching a live near miss, with a `docker-compose` for the Redis store.

> **Status — `1.0`, stable.** The cache, the ten guards, the in-memory / Redis / Postgres / HNSW stores,
> the threshold calibrator, an optional verifier, observability (events, Micrometer, SLF4J), and Spring
> Boot / Spring AI / LangChain4j / Ktor integrations are implemented and measured against a labelled
> corpus. The public API is stable under SemVer — see **[STABILITY.md](docs/STABILITY.md)**.

## Why Kmemo

- **Guards against false hits** — ten lexical checks catch near misses a threshold cannot: swapped
  numbers, units, entities, time references, negation, flipped antonyms, reversed comparisons, a
  different answer being asked for. They run against a labelled corpus on every build, and the numbers
  are reported honestly — see [Correctness, measured](#correctness-measured).
- **Safety by default** — the costs are asymmetric. A wrong rejection costs one API call; a wrong
  acceptance costs a wrong answer. Defaults follow that, and guards abstain rather than guess.
- **Calibrated, not copied** — `ThresholdCalibrator` measures the right threshold for *your* embedding
  model. A value from a blog post is tuned to somebody else's.
- **Provider-agnostic** — `Embedder` and `CacheStore` are one-method seams. Bring OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage
  or a local ONNX model; start in memory and move to a vector database without touching match logic.
- **Coroutine-first, small footprint** — every operation is a `suspend` function, and `kmemo-core`
  declares `kotlinx-coroutines-core` as its only dependency.

## Installation

Requires **JDK 17+**. Artifacts are published to Maven Central under `io.github.nacode-studios`.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.nacode-studios:kmemo-core:1.0.0")
}
```

You also need an embedding source — any function from `String` to `FloatArray`. Multi-module users can
pin one version with the BOM (`io.github.nacode-studios:kmemo-bom`); every module past `kmemo-core` is
opt-in and never lands on the core classpath.

## Usage

### Caching a call

`getOrPut` embeds the prompt once and reuses the vector for both the lookup and the write:

```kotlin
val answer = cache.getOrPut(prompt) { llm.complete(it) }
```

Concurrent callers asking the same thing are coalesced: the first computes, the rest wait and are served
its answer.

### Reading a miss

A cache whose hit rate is 4% is untunable unless you know *why* — the fix is opposite for a threshold
miss and a guard rejection. Every miss says which:

```kotlin
when (val result = cache.lookup(prompt)) {
    is CacheLookup.Hit  -> result.response
    is CacheLookup.Miss -> when (result.reason) {
        MissReason.BELOW_THRESHOLD   -> // traffic repeats less than you assumed, or threshold too tight
        MissReason.REJECTED_BY_GUARD -> // a guard found a concrete difference — result.detail says which
        else -> null
    }
}
```

`cache.explain(prompt)` is a read-only companion that shows every candidate with every guard's verdict —
reach for it when a hit you expected did not happen.

### Scopes

Anything that changes what a correct answer looks like — model, temperature, system prompt, tenant,
language — belongs in the scope, or the cache serves one model's answer to another's caller:

```kotlin
cache.getOrPut(prompt, scope = "gpt-4o|t=0.0|v3") { llm.complete(it) }
```

### Choosing guards

```kotlin
SemanticCache(embedder)                                    // MatchGuards.standard()
SemanticCache(embedder, guards = MatchGuards.strict())     // trades hit rate for margin
SemanticCache(embedder, guards = MatchGuards.none())       // the naive similarity-only baseline
```

The guards work outside English too — curated packs ship for Italian, Spanish, German and French, each
measured against a localized near-miss corpus:

```kotlin
SemanticCache(embedder, guards = MatchGuards.standard(Locale.ITALIAN))
```

### Typed and streaming responses

Cache more than a `String` — a structured object via a `ResponseCodec`, or a streamed answer replayed as
a `Flow` on a hit (caching only a stream that completes cleanly):

```kotlin
val weather: Weather = cache.getOrPut(prompt, weatherCodec) { llm.extractWeather(it) }

cache.getOrPutStreaming(prompt) { llm.completeStreaming(it) }.collect { print(it) }
```

### Observability

`stats()` gives lifetime counters (hit rate, per-reason and per-guard misses). For dashboards and logs,
subscribe to the event stream instead — free when unused:

```kotlin
val metrics = KmemoMetrics().also { it.bindTo(meterRegistry) }   // kmemo-micrometer
val cache = SemanticCache(embedder, listeners = listOf(metrics, Slf4jCacheListener()))
```

### Resilience

The `Embedder` is a network call on every lookup, so own its failure — fall back to the model when it is
down, retry transient blips, and warm the cache from an FAQ at startup:

```kotlin
val cache = SemanticCache(
    embedder = myEmbedder.retrying(maxAttempts = 4),
    embedFailurePolicy = EmbedFailurePolicy.FALL_BACK_TO_COMPUTE,
    negativeCacheSize = 10_000,
)
cache.warm(faqPairs.map { WarmEntry(it.question, it.answer) })
```

### Verifying what lexical guards cannot see

A third of near misses need world knowledge (`deworm a puppy` vs `an adult dog`, `boiling point of
ethanol` vs `methanol`). An optional `Verifier` — typically a cheap model call — runs only on candidates
that already cleared the threshold and every guard, and fails closed (a timeout or error rejects rather
than serving unconfirmed).

## Architecture

| Module | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `kmemo-core` | `SemanticCache`, the `Embedder` and `CacheStore` seams, the guard chain, `InMemoryStore`, `ThresholdCalibrator`, resilience, the `CacheEvent` stream — no provider or database knowledge. |
| `kmemo-store-redis` | A `CacheStore` on Redis (RediSearch KNN), for a cache shared across processes. |
| `kmemo-store-postgres` | A durable `CacheStore` on Postgres / pgvector. |
| `kmemo-store-hnsw` | An opt-in in-process approximate (HNSW) `CacheStore` that scales past the exact scan. |
| `kmemo-micrometer` / `kmemo-slf4j` | A Micrometer `MeterBinder` and an SLF4J logging listener. |
| `kmemo-spring-boot-starter` / `kmemo-spring-ai` | Auto-config for a `SemanticCache` bean, and a caching `Advisor` for Spring AI's `ChatClient`. |
| `kmemo-langchain4j` / `kmemo-ktor` | A caching `ChatModel` wrapper, and a Ktor server plugin. |
| `kmemo-bom` | A `java-platform` BOM to pin one version. |

A lookup is decided in stages, each cheaper than the one it protects:

```
prompt ─► embed ─► nearest 5 in scope ─► similarity ≥ threshold?
                                              │ no ─► MISS (below_threshold)
                                              ▼ yes
                                         guards ─► reject? ─► try next candidate ─► MISS (rejected_by_guard)
                                              ▼ pass
                                         verifier (optional) ─► reject? ─► MISS (rejected_by_verifier)
                                              ▼ pass
                                             HIT
```

### Correctness, measured

The guards are judged against three labelled corpora with a **blind validation split** no guard was
tuned against, run as a CI regression gate on every build. On the blind split, near misses are rejected
**67%** and paraphrases kept **88%** — neither is 100%, and the remaining near misses are the
world-knowledge cases the `Verifier` covers. The process for growing the blind splits without
contaminating them is [docs/CORPUS.md](docs/CORPUS.md); reproduce the numbers with:

```bash
./gradlew :kmemo-core:test --tests '*CorpusTest*'
```

## Roadmap

**Shipped (`1.0.0`)** — the guarded semantic cache, calibrated thresholds and an optional verifier; Redis,
Postgres and HNSW stores behind one `CacheStore` seam; resilience (embed-failure fall-back, retries,
negative caching, `warm`); observability (a `CacheEvent` stream, Micrometer, SLF4J); ergonomics (typed &
streaming `getOrPut`, a config DSL, a BOM); multilingual guard packs (IT/ES/DE/FR); and Spring Boot,
Spring AI, LangChain4j and Ktor integrations with a runnable [`examples/`](examples) demo. The public API
is stable under SemVer.

**Next (post-`1.0`)** — Kotlin Multiplatform (`commonMain`), and advanced matching (reranking/MMR,
near-duplicate eviction, adaptive thresholds).

See **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)** for the full milestone plan, **[STABILITY.md](docs/STABILITY.md)** for
the versioning / stability policy, and the shared **[roadmap conventions](ROADMAP-CONVENTIONS.md)**.

## Building and testing

```bash
./gradlew build         # compile, run unit tests, lint (ktlint + detekt), verify public API
./gradlew apiCheck      # check the tracked public API in *.api
./gradlew apiDump       # regenerate *.api after an intentional public-API change
./gradlew ktlintFormat  # auto-fix formatting before committing
```

Unit tests need no external services. The store integration tests spin up real backends with
[Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com) and are skipped automatically when Docker is unavailable.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Please run `./gradlew build` before
opening a pull request; if you change the public API, run `./gradlew apiDump` and commit the updated
`*.api` files.
