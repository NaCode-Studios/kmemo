An exact-match cache misses "how do I reverse a list in Python" when it has already answered "python
list reverse". A semantic cache does not: it embeds the prompt, finds the closest one it has seen,
and replays that answer instead of calling the model. Fewer API calls, lower latency, same answers —
except for the part where it hands back the wrong one.

```
"Convert 100 USD to EUR"
"Convert 250 USD to EUR"      cosine similarity: ~0.99
```

Every mainstream embedding model scores that pair around 0.99. No threshold separates it from a
genuine paraphrase, because on the similarity axis **the near miss is closer than most paraphrases
are**. So a cache built on a threshold alone will tell someone that 250 dollars is 92 euros —
quickly, with no error and nothing in the logs. kmemo treats that as the main event: similarity is
only the first filter, and candidates that clear it are read as text by a chain of guards looking for
concrete evidence the answers must differ.

```kotlin
val cache = SemanticCache(
    embedder = Embedder { text -> openAi.embed(text) },
    store = InMemoryStore(maxEntries = 10_000, ttl = 1.hours),
)

val answer = cache.getOrPut(prompt) { llm.complete(it) }
```

kmemo caches responses for embeddings you already have — `openAi.embed` above is your own embedding
source; kmemo ships none and depends on no provider SDK.

> **Status — early development.** The cache, the nine guards, the in-memory store and the threshold
> calibrator are implemented and tested against a labelled corpus. APIs may change before `1.0`.

## Why kmemo

- **Guards against false hits** — nine lexical checks catch the near misses a threshold cannot:
  swapped numbers, units, entities, time references, negation, flipped antonyms, reversed
  comparisons, a different answer being asked for. Measured, not asserted: **68 of 71 near misses
  rejected, 0 of 38 genuine paraphrases rejected**, on every build.
- **Safety by default** — the costs are asymmetric. A wrong rejection costs one API call, the exact
  call you would have made without a cache. A wrong acceptance costs a wrong answer. Defaults follow
  that, and guards abstain rather than guess.
- **Calibrated, not copied** — `ThresholdCalibrator` measures the right threshold for *your*
  embedding model. A value from a blog post is tuned to somebody else's.
- **Provider-agnostic** — `Embedder` and `CacheStore` are one-method seams. Bring OpenAI, Cohere,
  Voyage or a local ONNX model; start in memory and move to a vector database without touching
  match logic.
- **Coroutine-first, small footprint** — every operation is a `suspend` function, and the published
  artifact depends on `kotlinx-coroutines-core` and nothing else.
- **Diagnosable** — every miss reports *why*. A cache with a 4% hit rate is untunable unless you know
  whether prompts land below the threshold or are vetoed by a guard; the fix is opposite in each case.

## Installation

Requires **JDK 17+**. Artifacts are published to Maven Central under `io.github.nacode-studios`.

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.nacode-studios:kmemo-core:0.1.0")
}
```

> **Not published yet.** `0.1.0` is unreleased. Until it ships, build it locally with
> `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` and add `mavenLocal()` to your repositories.

You also need an embedding source. Any function from `String` to `FloatArray` will do.

## Usage

### Caching a call

```kotlin
val answer = cache.getOrPut(prompt) { llm.complete(it) }
```

`getOrPut` embeds the prompt **once** and reuses the vector for both the lookup and the write. Doing
it by hand with `get` then `put` costs two embedding calls on every miss.

### Reading a miss

```kotlin
when (val result = cache.lookup(prompt)) {
    is CacheLookup.Hit -> log.info("hit at {} (age {})", result.similarity, result.age)
    is CacheLookup.Miss -> log.info("miss: {} — {}", result.reason, result.detail)
}
```

`MissReason` is one of `EMPTY_SCOPE`, `BELOW_THRESHOLD`, `REJECTED_BY_GUARD` or
`REJECTED_BY_VERIFIER`, and `detail` names the guard that fired and why.

### Scopes

Anything that changes what a correct answer looks like belongs in the scope string — model,
temperature, system prompt, tenant, user language. Lookups only ever see their own scope.

```kotlin
cache.getOrPut(prompt, scope = "gpt-4o|t=0.0|sysprompt-v3") { llm.complete(it) }
```

Without this, a cache shared between two models will serve one model's answer to the other's caller.
It is the second most common way a hand-rolled semantic cache goes wrong.

### Choosing guards

```kotlin
SemanticCache(embedder)                                            // MatchGuards.standard()
SemanticCache(embedder, guards = MatchGuards.strict())             // trades hit rate for margin
SemanticCache(embedder, guards = MatchGuards.none())               // the naive baseline
SemanticCache(embedder, guards = MatchGuards.standard() + MyGuard())
```

Every guard takes its word lists as a constructor parameter, so adapting to another language is
configuration rather than a fork:

```kotlin
NegationGuard(markers = setOf("non", "senza", "mai"))
```

### Verifying what lexical guards cannot see

Two prompts that differ only in world knowledge — `bake salmon fillets` versus `bake chicken
breasts` — are invisible to a lexical guard. A `Verifier` runs only on candidates that already
cleared the threshold and every guard, so it fires on a small fraction of lookups:

```kotlin
val verifier = Verifier { query, cached, _ ->
    haiku.complete("Same correct answer? Reply YES or NO.\nA: $cached\nB: $query").startsWith("YES")
}
```

### Calibrating the threshold

```kotlin
val report = ThresholdCalibrator(myEmbedder).calibrate(myLabelledPairs)
println(report.summary())

val cache = SemanticCache(myEmbedder, threshold = report.recommended.threshold)
```

A hundred pairs from your own traffic is plenty, and half should be near misses. Pairs that are
obviously unrelated teach the calibrator nothing, because no threshold ever confuses them.

### Observability

```kotlin
val stats = cache.stats()
stats.hitRate            // fraction served from cache
stats.guardRejections    // wrong answers that were not served
stats.belowThreshold     // prompts that simply did not repeat
```

A high `belowThreshold` means your traffic repeats less than you assumed, or your threshold is too
tight for your model. A high `guardRejections` means the opposite — prompts are landing close
together and the guards are catching near misses your threshold alone would have served.

## Architecture

| Module | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `kmemo-core` | `SemanticCache`, the `Embedder` and `CacheStore` seams, the guard chain, `InMemoryStore`, `ThresholdCalibrator` — and no provider or database knowledge. |

A lookup is decided in four stages, each cheaper than the one it protects:

```
prompt ──► embed ──► nearest 5 in scope ──► similarity ≥ threshold?
                                                  │ no ──► MISS (below_threshold)
                                                  ▼ yes
                                             guards ──► reject? ──► try next candidate ──► MISS (rejected_by_guard)
                                                  ▼ pass
                                             verifier (optional) ──► reject? ──► MISS (rejected_by_verifier)
                                                  ▼ pass
                                                 HIT
```

Looking past the nearest neighbour matters: when a guard vetoes the closest entry, the second closest
is often a perfectly good answer.

### The guards

| Guard | Rejects when | Example it catches |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NumericGuard` | the prompts contain different numbers | `100 USD` vs `250 USD` |
| `UnitGuard` | units or currencies are substituted | `50 km to miles` vs `50 km to meters` |
| `TemporalGuard` | different absolute time reference | `weather today` vs `weather tomorrow` |
| `NegationGuard` | one prompt is negated, the other is not | `should I eat X` vs `should I not eat X` |
| `AntonymGuard` | a word is flipped to its opposite | `enable 2FA` vs `disable 2FA` |
| `EntityGuard` | named entities are swapped | `capital of Australia` vs `capital of Austria` |
| `ScopeGuard` | a different answer is asked for | `write a haiku` vs `write a sonnet` |
| `DirectionGuard` | same words, reversed comparison or conversion | `EUR to USD` vs `USD to EUR` |
| `LexicalDivergenceGuard` | the prompts share almost no content words | backstop for everything else |

`LengthRatioGuard` ships too, but stays out of `standard()`: "python list reverse" and "How do I
reverse a list in Python?" are a four-fold difference in length and the same question.

The interesting engineering is in **not** over-rejecting:

- `EntityGuard` and `UnitGuard` reject a *substitution*, never an *addition* — so "what does SOLID
  stand for in OOP" still matches "what does each letter of SOLID mean in object oriented design",
  and `km` and `kilometers` are one unit rather than a swap.
- `AntonymGuard` counts occurrences instead of testing membership, so "turn **on** format **on**
  save" vs "turn **off** format **on** save" is caught even though both prompts contain `on`.
- `DirectionGuard` fires only on a comparison or conversion cue, and ignores rotations. Moving a
  trailing phrase to the front never changes the question: "How do I move a file in Linux?" and "In
  Linux, how do I move a file?" stay a hit, while "is A better than B" and "is B better than A" do
  not.
- `LexicalDivergenceGuard` matches typos and inflections fuzzily (`instal` → `install`, `cahce` →
  `cache`, `commit` → `committed`) but caps fuzziness at one edit, deliberately too strict to merge
  `Austria` with `Australia`.

### Correctness, measured

kmemo ships a corpus of **109 labelled prompt pairs** (`near-miss-corpus.json`): 71 that must never
share a cached answer, and 38 genuine paraphrases that must. The near misses are mostly a single
token apart, because that is where a semantic cache actually breaks. The corpus carries its own
control group, so a guard set that rejects everything scores zero rather than looking perfect.

```
category                  pairs   standard     strict
comparative-direction         8       100%       100%   must not match
entity-swap                  13        85%        85%   must not match
negation                      7       100%       100%   must not match
numeric-swap                 13       100%       100%   must not match
polarity-antonym              7       100%       100%   must not match
scope-shift                   8        88%        88%   must not match
temporal                      7       100%       100%   must not match
unit-swap                     8       100%       100%   must not match
paraphrase                   13       100%        62%   must match
politeness                    6       100%       100%   must match
typo                          6       100%       100%   must match
verbosity                     7       100%       100%   must match
word-order                    6       100%       100%   must match
```

The three near misses that get through are honest limitations: two need world knowledge (`bake
salmon fillets` vs `bake chicken breasts`) and one is an unmarked depth qualifier (`how does HTTPS
work` vs `how does HTTPS work at the packet level`). That is what the `Verifier` hook is for.

Note that `strict()` catches nothing extra on this corpus while rejecting 38% of paraphrases. It
exists for traffic whose near misses are lexically distant in ways this corpus does not model —
measure it against your own pairs before choosing it.

Running the calibrator over the same corpus with a deliberately adversarial stub embedder that scores
every near miss above 0.99:

| | best false-hit rate reachable | precision there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| similarity threshold alone | **35.2%** (no threshold in `0.70..0.99` did better) | 0.19 |
| similarity + standard guards | **0%**, at threshold 0.81 | 1.00 |

Guards do not merely reduce false hits — they let you run a *lower* threshold safely, which returns
more hits than the similarity-only configuration managed at any setting.

> The stub embedder is built to make near misses look identical, so these false-hit figures
> demonstrate the mechanism honestly. The absolute recall numbers are not representative of a real
> embedding model, which rewards paraphrases in a way the stub deliberately does not.

## Roadmap

**Now** — `SemanticCache` with scopes, stats and typed misses; `Embedder` and `CacheStore` seams;
nine guards plus an opt-in `LengthRatioGuard`; an optional `Verifier`; `InMemoryStore` with TTL and
LRU; `ThresholdCalibrator`; the labelled corpus.

**Next** — Redis and Postgres/pgvector stores, a Spring AI `Advisor` and a LangChain4j wrapper
(neither framework ships a semantic cache), request coalescing for concurrent identical misses, and
non-English vocabularies.

## Building and testing

```bash
./gradlew build          # compile, test, verify public API (binary-compatibility-validator)
./gradlew apiCheck       # check the tracked public API in *.api
./gradlew apiDump        # regenerate *.api after an intentional public-API change

./gradlew :kmemo-core:test --tests '*NearMissCorpusTest*'   # the corpus report above
```

The build runs with explicit API mode and `allWarningsAsErrors`. Tests need no external services —
104 of them, all offline.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Please run `./gradlew build`
before opening a pull request; if you change the public API, run `./gradlew apiDump` and commit the
updated `*.api` files.

Guard changes have a stricter bar: they must be measured against the corpus, and a guard may never
reject a genuine paraphrase. A near-miss pair that slips through is a useful contribution on its own,
even without a fix.
